  "My sisterâ€™s boy (younger brother or close friend) is very caring."
or simply
"My brother is caring."

Itâ€™s a lovely, warm way to describe someone who looks after and supports you kindly.

ðŸ’™ Let me know if you want to translate it beautifully or turn it into a cute caption or poetic line! ðŸŒ·âœ¨
